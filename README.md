# Project_adhoc

<br>
Wireless networks are all around us. Cell phones communicate with a base-station to send and
receive calls. Calls are relayed from base-station to base-station as the cell phone moves away from
one and closer to another. A new idea of organizing networks is to avoid the need for a central
base-station that coordinates communications. Instead, messages are relayed by “hopping” from
one node to the next to the next until it reaches its destination. In other words, one can send a
message by using other devices in the network to relay the message to the next device, and so on.
These are called ad hoc networks because there is no centralized node or fixed structure or topology
for the network. Instead, devices can move over time, and dynamically enter and exit the network.
And so the route a message takes from one device to another depends on the other nodes.

<br>
Ad hoc networks are very promising and becoming important. At their most immediately
practical, ad hoc networks can allow nodes outside of a regular network to communicate by piggybacking off of nodes within the network. Think of driving along and being between base-stations
and so your cell phone call would be dropped. But because of ad hoc networks, your data is relayed
through cell phones in other cars closer to the base stations. More ambitously, ad hoc networks
might be used in controlling traffic on highways by allowing cars communicate with each other.

<br>
A very basic aspect of ad hoc networks that people need to understand is how the communication
and complete connectivity changes with respect to the broadcasting power. Increased power levels
allow one to send a message over a larger distance.

<br>
The goal of the project is to find the best way to set up the power of the nodes to run the system
